# Braille Detection System

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: API Key Configuration Required

The detector is currently showing zero detections because the Roboflow API key is incomplete. Here's how to fix it:

### Current Issue
- The current API key `"RzOXFbriJONcee7MHKN8"` is only 16 characters long
- Roboflow API keys are typically 32+ characters
- The API returns 403 (Access Denied) because the key is invalid

### How to Fix

1. **Get a Valid Roboflow API Key:**
   - Go to [https://roboflow.com/account](https://roboflow.com/account)
   - Sign in to your account
   - Navigate to "API Keys" section
   - Copy your full API key (should be 32+ characters)

2. **Set the Environment Variable:**
   
   **For Local Development:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   set ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=your_full_api_key_here
   
   # Linux/Mac
   export ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=your_full_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **For Vercel Deployment:**
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` with your full API key value

3. **Verify the API Key:**
   ```bash
   python test_detector.py
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```
   ✅ API key appears to be valid
   ```

### Alternative: Use a Different API Key

If you don't have access to the original Roboflow account, you can:

1. **Create a new Roboflow account** at [https://roboflow.com](https://roboflow.com)
2. **Train your own braille detection model** or use a public one
3. **Update the workspace and model information** in the code

### Code Structure

```

### Testing

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
cd cloud
python test_detector.py
```

### Expected Output After Fix

```

### Troubleshooting

1. **403 Access Denied:** API key is invalid or doesn't have access to the model
2. **401 Unauthorized:** API key is expired or malformed
3. **404 Not Found:** Model or workspace doesn't exist
4. **Zero Detections:** Check image quality and API key validity

### Next Steps

Once the API key is properly configured:

1. The detector should start finding braille characters
2. The web interface will show detection results
3. The AI assistant will be able to process the detected text

### Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the Roboflow model is still active and accessible
2. Verify the workspace name `braille-to-text-0xo2p` is correct
3. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions
